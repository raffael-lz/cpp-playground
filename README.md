# CppStuff
Personal playground for C++.
Examples and ideas from Books like "Effective Modern C++"" from Scott Meyers, "Effective C++ Third Edition" from Scott Meyers, "The C++ Programming Language" from Bjarne Stroustrup" etc.
Every time I find something which I don't understand at all or I want to play with it, I will try to create some examples.
